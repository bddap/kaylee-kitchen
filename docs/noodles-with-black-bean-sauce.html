      <p>stir-fry the pork belly in a large, deep wok with 1 Tablespoon of vegetable oil for about 4-5 minutes, until golden brown and crispy.</p>
      
      <p>Pour out the excess pork fat.</p>
      
      <p>Add radish and stir fry for 1 minute.</p>
      
      <p>Add potato, onion, and zucchini and keep stirring for about 3 minutes until the potato looks a little translucent.</p>
      
      <p>Clear a space in the center of the wok by pushing the ingredients to the edges.</p>
      
      <p>Add 2 Tablespoons of vegetable oil to the center of the wok, then add ¼ cup of black bean paste and stir it with a wooden spoon for 1 minute to fry it. Then mix everything in the wok and keep stirring.</p>
      
      <p>Add  2 cups of water to the wok and let it cook with the lid closed for about 10 minutes.</p>
      
      <p>Open the lid and taste a sample of the radish and potato. If they’re fully cooked, stir in the starch water little by little. Keep stirring until it’s well mixed and thick.</p>
      
      <p>Add the sesame oil and remove from the heat.</p>
      
      <p>Serve with noodles (jjajangmyeon) or steamed rice (jjajangbap).</p>
      
      <p>Garnish with cucumber strips on top of the jjajang sauce and serve it with kimchi or yellow pickled radish.</p>
