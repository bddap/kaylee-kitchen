      <p>Prepare beef:</p>
      
      <p>In a small bowl stir together the soy sauce, sugar, salt and beef and let it marinate for 20 minutes.</p>
      
      <p>Make the sauce while the beef is marinating:</p>
      
      <p>In a small bowl dissolve the cornstarch in the soy sauce and stir in the Sherry, the broth, the sugar, and the sesa- me oil.</p>
      
      <p>Cook meat and broccoli:</p>
      
      <p>Heat wok or large heavy skillet over high heat until it</p>
      
      <p>is hot, add 2 Tbsp of the vegetable oil, and heat it un-</p>
      
      <p>til it just begins to smoke. Stir-fry the beef in the oil in small batches for 1 minute, or until it is no longer pink, and transfer it as it is cooked with a slotted spoon to a plate. Add the remaining 1 Tbsp of vegatable oil to the wok, heat it until it is hot but not smoking, and in the</p>
      
      <p>oil stir-fry the gingerroot, the garlic, and the chili for 30 seconds, or until the mixture is fragrant. Add the broc- coli and stir-fry the mixture for 1 minute. Add 1/3 cup water and steam the broccoli, covered, for 1 to 2 min. Stir in sauce, add it to the wok with the beef and any broth that has accumulated on the plate, and cook the mixture, stirring for 2 minute, or until the sauce is thickened and the beef is heated through.</p>
      
      <p>Serve with rice. Makes 2 servings.</p>
