      <p>Combine butter and milk and heat until butter is just melted - on stove or in microwave.</p>
      
      <p>Combine 2 cups flour, salt, butter and milk.</p>
      
      <p>Sprinkle work surface with flour then knead for a few minutes until it is smooth - it doesn’t need much knead- ing. Add extra flour if the dough is too sticky.</p>
      
      <p>Wrap with cling wrap and rest at room temperature for 30 minutes or so.</p>
      
      <p>Dust bench top with flour, cut dough into 4 pieces, roll into balls, then roll out into about 1/8” / 0.3cm thick rounds.</p>
      
      <p>Heat 1/2 tbsp olive oil in a non stick pan over medium heat - or lower if you have a heavy based skillet. (Note 1) Place one flatbread in the pan, cook for around 1- 1 1/2 minutes - it should bubble up (see photo in post)- then flip and cook the other side, pressing down if it puffs up. There should be a smallish golden brown spots on both sides.</p>
      
      <p>Stack the cooked bread and keep wrapped with a tea towel - the moisture helps soften the surface, making them even more pliable.</p>
      
      <p>Continue to cook with remaining pieces.</p>
      
      <p>Optional: Brush or spray bread with olive oil or melted butter, for a more luxurious finish. Or even with melt- ed butter mixed with minced garlic for a garlic butter version!</p>
