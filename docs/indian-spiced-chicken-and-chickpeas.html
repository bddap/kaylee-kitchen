      <p>Preheat oven to 325° F. with rack in lower 1/3 of oven.</p>
      
      <p>Pan chicken dry and season with salt and pepper. Heat 1 Tbsp. oil in an oven-safe pan (with a lid, such as a Dutch oven) on stove-top over medium-high heat.</p>
      
      <p>Brown chicken on both sides until golden and remove to a plate.</p>
      
      <p>Add butter and onions to pan (don’t remove drippings unless exces- sive).</p>
      
      <p>Cook, stirring regularly, until onions are soft and golden brown, about 10 minutes. (Don’t rush browning the onions, as cooking them to golden adds great flavour to the dish).</p>
      
      <p>Stir in garlic, ginger and spices.</p>
      
      <p>Cook, stirring constantly, about 1 minute. Stir in chickpeas and 2 cups of broth. Return chicken to pan and any accumulated juices. Liquid should cover chicken by about 2/3. If not, add a bit more broth to top up.</p>
      
      <p>Bring liquid to a simmer, then cover and transfer to the pre-heated oven. Cook until chicken is fork-tender, about 45 minutes, depending on the cut of chicken you used.</p>
      
      <p>Remove from oven and transfer chicken to a plate.</p>
      
      <p>Cover with foil to keep warm. To hot liquid in pot, add spinach. Cover and let stand about 5 minutes, or until spinach is wilted. Stir in yogurt.</p>
      
      <p>Taste and season with salt and pepper, to taste. (If sauce is not as</p>
      
      <p>thick as you’d like, mix a bit of the sauce with a couple of teaspoons of cornstarch to make a paste.</p>
      
      <p>Add a bit at a time to the warm sauce and stir until desired thickness). Return chicken to pot and warm over low heat (do not boil or yogurt may curdle).</p>
      
      <p>Transfer chicken to a serving platter and pour spinach and chickpea sauce over. Sprinkle with chopped cilantro or parsley.</p>
