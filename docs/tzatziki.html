      <p>The only imperative in this recipe is to remove LOTS of the liquid from the cucumbers so the final dip will be nice and thick. Cut the cucumbers and then mince them really, really fine.</p>
      
      <p>Put the salted cucumbers in a fine strainer over a bowl. Just let it hang out a while, while you are working on the other ingre- dients. I think I let mine drain for probably 20 minutes or so.</p>
      
      <p>While the cucumbers are draining, let’s get on with the rest. Into a bowl, add your plain, Greek yogurt. Next I added the sour cream, add the rest of the seasonings: champagne vine- gar, lemon juice, olive oil, garlic, dill, and pepper.</p>
      
      <p>Pour out the minced, salted cucumbers onto a clean tea towel. Gather it up and SQUEEZE!!!! And then squeeze HARDER! You can see how much more of the liquid is coming out. After you can no longer squeeze out any liquid from the cucumbers, add the cucumber “pulp” (well that’s what it looks like to me at this point) into the yogurt mixture. Now mix to combine. Taste and adjust any seasonings. More dill? Pepper? Salt?</p>
      
      <p>It’s best if you let the flavors marry for several hours or even overnight. If you are making it for a party, I would suggest making it the day before. Serve as you wish. I served it with pita bread triangles, sliced cucumbers, and strips of sweet yellow and red bell peppers.</p>
