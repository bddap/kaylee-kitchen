      <p>Equipment</p>
      
      <p>Stock pot</p>
      
      <p>one - 2 gallon glass jar or four - 2 quart glass jars Tightly woven cloth (like clean napkins or tea towels), coffee filters, or paper towels, to cover the jar</p>
      
      <p>Bottles: Six 32-oz glass bottles with plastic lids</p>
      
      <p>Small funnel</p>
      
      <p>Note: Avoid prolonged contact between the kombucha and metal</p>
      
      <p>both during and after brewing. This can affect the flavor of your kombucha and weaken the scoby over time.</p>
      
      <p>Make the tea base: Bring the water to a boil. Remove from heat and stir in the sugar to dissolve. Drop in the tea and allow it to steep until the water has cooled.</p>
      
      <p>Add the starter tea: Once the tea is cool, remove the tea bags or strain out the loose tea. Stir in the starter tea. (The starter tea makes the liquid acidic, which prevents unfriendly bacteria from taking up residence in the first few days of fermentation.)</p>
      
      <p>Transfer to jars and add the scoby: Pour the mixture into 2-gallon glass jar (or divide between four 2-quart jars, in which case youâ€™ll need 4 scobys) and gently slide the scoby into the jar with clean hands. Cover the mouth of the jar with a few layers tightly-woven cloth.</p>
      
      <p>Ferment for 7 to 10 days:</p>
      
      <p>After 7 days, begin tasting the kombucha daily by pouring a little out of the jar and into a cup. When it reaches a balance of sweetness and tartness that is pleasant to you, the kombucha is ready to bottle.</p>
      
      <p>Remove the scoby:</p>
      
      <p>Bottle the finished kombucha: Measure out your starter tea from this batch of kombucha and set it aside for the next batch. Pour the fermented kombucha (straining, if desired) into bottles using the small funnel, along with any juice, herbs, or fruit you may want to use as flavoring. Leave about a half inch of head room in each bottle.</p>
      
      <p>Carbonate and refrigerate the finished kombucha: Store the bottled kombucha at room temperature out of direct sunlight and allow 1 to 3 days for the kombucha to carbonate. Refrigerate to stop fermentation and carbonation, and then consume your kombucha within a month.</p>
      
      <p>Make a fresh batch of kombucha: Clean the jar being used for kombucha fermentation. Combine the starter tea from your last batch of kombucha with the fresh batch of sugary tea, and pour it into the fermentation jar. Slide the scoby on top, cover, and ferment for 7 to 10 days.</p>
